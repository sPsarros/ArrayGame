<h1>Array Game</h1> 
<h4>Hello everybody!</h4> 
In this game, you have been given an random array with 10 pairs in total of characters. Once you are ready, all characters will disappear and transform into a hidden one, so memorize the positions of every character. Every player can make a mistake only 4 times, on the 4th time the game will stop. If the player manages to find all the right positions, the game stops and he wins. </br>
If you have any suggestion to improve the code or the functionality of the game, don't be afraid to let me know. I will happily read your comments!
